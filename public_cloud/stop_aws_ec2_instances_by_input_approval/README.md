```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh

```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-samples.git
cd public_cloud/stop_aws_ec2_instances_by_input_approval
```

[Install mod dependencies](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies):

```sh
flowpipe mod install
```

## Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws).

You need to update the `integration.fpc` present in the current directory and provide the channel information:

```sh
integration "slack" "slack_app" {
  token = env("SLACK_TOKEN")
}

notifier "slack" {
  notify {
    integration = integration.slack.slack_app
    channel     = "#random"
  }
}
```

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `SLACK_TOKEN`

You can also create `credential` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/slack.fpc
```

```hcl
credential "slack" "default" {
  token = "xoxp-12345-..."
}
```

For more information on credentials in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Credentials](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/credentials).

## Usage

Run the pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run stop_aws_ec2_instances_by_input_approval
```

  smtps_port    = 587
  smtp_username = "<Email Username>"
  smtp_password = "<Email APP Password>"
  from          = "<Email Username>"
}

notifier "email_notifier" {
  notify {
    integration = integration.email.gmail
    to          = ["test@gmail.com"]
    subject     = "Deactivated expired AWS IAM Keys"

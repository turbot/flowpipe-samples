# AWS IAM User Group Membership

Check for AWS IAM users with multiple group membership and automate GitHub issue management at 9 AM UTC on weekdays.

If run with `flowpipe server`, this mod will create/update/close GitHub issues every weekday at 9 AM UTC.

## Requirements

Docker daemon must be installed and running. Please see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more information.

## Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-samples.git
cd public_cloud/aws_iam_user_group_membership
```

[Install mod dependencies](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies):

```sh
flowpipe mod install
```

## Connections

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `AWS_PROFILE`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_PROFILE`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`

You can also create `connection` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi conns.fpc
```

```hcl
connection "aws" "aws_profile" {
  profile = "my-profile"
}

connection "aws" "aws_access_key_pair" {
  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "dP+C+J..."
}

connection "aws" "aws_session_token" {
  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "dP+C+J..."
  session_token = "AQoDX..."
}

connection "github" "default" {
  token = "ghp_..."
}
```

For more information on connections in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Connections](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/connections).

## Usage

Run the pipeline to check IAM user group membership and manage corresponding GitHub issues immediately:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run aws_iam_user_group_membership --arg github_repository_owner=my_gh_org --arg github_repository_name=my_gh_repo
```

To perform the IAM user group membership check at the scheduled time, start the Flowpipe server:

```sh
flowpipe server
```

Once started, Flowpipe will run the pipeline automatically at the scheduled time.

## Configuration

To avoid entering variable values when running the pipeline or starting the server, you can set variable values:

```sh
cp flowpipe.fpvars.example flowpipe.fpvars
vi flowpipe.fpvars
```

```hcl
# Optional
# github_conn = "non_default_conn"
# aws_conn    = "non_default_conn"
```

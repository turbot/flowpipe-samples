# Input Examples

This mod contains a collection of input types examples for the notification feature.

## Usage

Notifications requires Flowpipe to be running in [server mode](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server), so let's start the Flowpipe server:

```sh
flowpipe server --verbose
```

Then, in another terminal, run the pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run button_example  --host local
```

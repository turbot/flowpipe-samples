# IP Profiler

Get valuable information about IP addresses by bringing data together from AbuseIPDB, ReallyFreeGeoIP, and VirusTotal.

## Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

cd networking/ip_profiler
```

[Install mod dependencies](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies):

```

## Connections

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`
- `VTCLI_APIKEY`

You can also create `connection` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/connections.fpc
```

```hcl
connection "abuseipdb" "default" {
  api_key = "hJ2lFgP7nR9sT4xVhJ2lFgP7nR9sT4xV8aZ0bC3qW6mO1eK5dH7jI9lM3nA2oZ8vB0xK4yV1cX6eA9ds"
}

connection "virustotal" "default" {
  api_key = "AG.U7..."
}
```

No connections are required for ReallyFreeGeoIP.

For more information on connections in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Connections](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/connections).

## Usage

Run the pipeline and specify the `ip_addresses` pipeline argument:

```sh

```
